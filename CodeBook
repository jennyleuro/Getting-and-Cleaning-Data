# Variables

The Data provides Identififiers
- Subject: the participant's ID
- Activity: the activity tipe

And measurements, of which were taken the means and standard deviations.

# Modifications
To clean up the data, following the instructions in the course, there was 5 steps:
1. Merging the Data. Where, the data readed was merged by the functions cbind() and rbin()
2. Extracting the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement: Where through the function select() on the merged data was selectioned the ID variables and the measurements corresponding to the mean and estandard deviation
3. Assigning activity names: Then, with the file of the Activity labels, the names of the activities were assigned according to the code
4. Assigning descriptive variable names: Where some of the variable names were modified through the function gsub()
5. Create a data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. Finally here we get the tidy_data file.
